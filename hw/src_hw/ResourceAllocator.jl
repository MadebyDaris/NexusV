# Resource-constrained list scheduling for NexusV dataflow graphs.
# Given a resource budget (e.g. "1 multiplier, 2 ALUs"), this module
# serializes operations that would otherwise oversubscribe shared hardware.
# Depends on DFG_Builder types and Scheduler (finish_cycle, topological_sort).

# Resource-constrained list scheduling.

# Like schedule_asap!, but respects a resource budget. Operations that share
# the same functional unit are serialized so that no unit is oversubscribed.
#
# Arguments:
#   - graph:  a scheduled HWGraph (call schedule_asap! first to set latencies)
#   - budget: ResourceBudget, e.g. Dict(:ALU => 2, :MUL => 1)
#
# Returns the graph with updated scheduled_cycle and latency fields.
#
# Example:
#   schedule_asap!(graph)          # sets latencies from OP_LATENCY
#   budget = ResourceBudget(:ALU => 1, :MUL => 1)
#   schedule_list!(graph, budget)  # re-schedules with resource constraints
